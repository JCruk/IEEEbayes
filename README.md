If you open the .Rproj file first, you shouldn't have any path issues. 

Note that the chunks in the Rmd file that run the models are set to `eval = FALSE`, meaning that they won't run when you knit the document. This is to save time. If you want to change the models, just make sure to save the new RData output.
